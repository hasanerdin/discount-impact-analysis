🛒 Eniac Discount Impact Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Data Analytics course at WBS Coding School.
We worked as a group of Data Analysts for Eniac — an e-commerce tech company, tasked with analyzing the impact of discount strategies on business performance.
The goal was to help stakeholders settle an ongoing debate:
Marketing Team Lead argues that discounts boost customer acquisition, satisfaction, and retention, fueling long-term growth.
Board investors worry that aggressive discounts increase orders but reduce total revenue, pushing the company away from its preferred quality market positioning.
Our mission: Use Python-based data analysis to evaluate whether discounting is ultimately beneficial.

🔧 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Data Cleaning & Wrangling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization for insights presentation

📊 Key Tasks

Cleaned and structured messy internal sales data.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify discount-related patterns.
Compared orders, revenues, and customer behaviors across discounted vs. non-discounted products.
Visualized findings to support decision-making.

📈 Insights (Example – adapt with your real findings)

Discounts increased order volume significantly, especially from new customers.
However, average revenue per order dropped, affecting profitability.
Retention effects of discounts were mixed — some customers stayed, while others only purchased during discount periods.

🤝 Teamwork

This was a collaborative group project, where we divided tasks such as:
Data cleaning & preprocessing
EDA & statistical analysis
Visualization & storytelling
Final presentation of results

🚀 Conclusion

Our analysis provided the company with a data-driven perspective on the trade-offs of discounts, helping balance short-term sales growth with long-term revenue sustainability.
